  ## Description
  I made this application to make it easier to make a professional README.md file. With this application it makes sure you do not forget a section in your README. This solves the problem of switching between a templet and your file. Everything is in one location. I learned how to utilize the command line within VS and how to use Node.js. I was able to learn how to implement a NPM and how it is installed.
