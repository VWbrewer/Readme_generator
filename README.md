  ## Description
  
  I made this application to make it easier to make a professional README.md file. With this application it makes sure you do not forget a section in your README. This solves the problem of switching between a template and your file. Everything is in one location. I learned how to utilize the command line within VS and how to use Node.js. I was able to learn how to implement a NPM and how it is installed.

  ## Installation
  
  The steps to install this application are straight forward:

  Right click the index.js file and select the option to open in Integrated Terminal

  Within the Terminal type “npm install inquirer” let that install

  Next within the Terminal type “node index.js” 

  Follow the prompts and will have created a professional README.md file to add to your project.
